<p>I politely steal this from the documentation,</p>
<ul>
<li>“The first layer is an embedding layer. <mark>This layer takes the
integer-encoded vocabulary and looks up the embedding vector for each
word-index.</mark> These vectors are learned as the model trains. The
vectors add a dimension to the output array. The resulting dimensions
are: (batch, sequence, embedding).”</li>
</ul>
<p>So the <code>word embedding layer</code>does indeed
<code>expand</code> the dimensions for each <code>word index</code>. It
learns these as it trains. Once complete, we can go back and pluck this
layer out and go start to visualize words from our corpus against one
another. Maybe we could perform the famous
<code>man - woman = king - queen</code> example? More to follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Next, a <code>global_average_pooling_1d layer</code> returns a
fixed-length output vector for each example by <mark>averaging over the
sequence dimension</mark>. This allows the model to handle input of
variable length, in the simplest way possible.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I gladly steal more excellent interpretation</p>
<p>” HIDDEN UNITS The above model has two intermediate or “hidden”
layers, between the input and output. The number of outputs (units,
nodes, or neurons) is the dimension of the representational space for
the layer. In other words, the amount of freedom the network is allowed
when learning an internal representation.</p>
<p>If a model has more hidden units (a higher-dimensional representation
space), and/or more layers, then the network can learn more complex
representations. However, it makes the network more computationally
expensive and may lead to learning unwanted patterns — patterns that
improve performance on training data but not on the test data. This is
called overfitting, and we’ll explore it later”</p>

<p>Kind of amazing. Words such as …</p>
<ul>
<li>Outstanding</li>
<li>Breathtaking</li>
<li>Fantastic</li>
<li>Guido (which is usually a term for awesome)</li>
<li>Damon (probably for Matt Damon, who is pretty awesome)</li>
</ul>
<p>… are all in just this little region. We learned a lot in this little
model. Let’s look at one more visual with just our first two dimensions
of word embeddings without <code>pca</code>.</p>

<p>Pretty amazing, even just the first few layers of word embeddings
show the same thing. Words like:</p>
<ul>
<li>awful</li>
<li>waste</li>
<li>jawbreaker</li>
<li>rediculous</li>
<li>stupid</li>
<li>stupidity</li>
</ul>
<p>Incredible. This language model has learned words from our custom
domain.</p>
<p>One can only imagine that there are two populations of words because
this domain was specifically trained on them.</p>
<p>Another exercise is to flow these files from the directory
structure.</p>
