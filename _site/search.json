I am a lover of optimization. I enjoy learning, data\r\nresearch, and teaching others. This blog is a manifestation of these\r\nthree elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+\r\n-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Photo, Boom!Experience\r\nI’ve been working in software and analytics my entire career (about 6\r\nyears now). I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in\r\nMathematics. This is where my love for optimization began, but in\r\ndisguise. I took several data science classes, data mining being one of\r\nthem, and was completely amazed with the model formulations for\r\nK-means Clustering, posterior updating with\r\nEM Clustering, and how most problems are intractable\r\nwithout heuristic solutions. I never had a full appreciation for the\r\nbreadth or depth of the field. In fact, it still grows daily.\r\nMy primary experience is as Operations Research Analyst (ORSA), but I\r\nhave about 2 years experience as Data Scientist also. I currently serve\r\nas an ORSA. This gave me the ability to see how to make optimization\r\nreal. The range of problems and solutions that optimization can solve\r\nare incredible, and real world experience working with the military and\r\nindustry has shed light on this.\r\nOver my career I have accumulated an M.S. in Operations Research.\r\nThis is where my deep love for optimization was solidified. Taking every\r\noptimization course possible, from linear programming, non-linear\r\nprogramming, integer programming, network flows, stochastic processes,\r\nmulti-attribute decision making, supply chain optimization, and more.\r\nThis is a beautiful field, and I hope to explore and share as much as I\r\ncan here on this blog!\r\nI am currently an M.E. Industrial Engineering student with about a\r\nyear remaining. I receive a Graduate Certificate in Systems Engineering\r\nthis fall, which I am very excited about. Industrial & Systems\r\nEngineering are very closely related to Operations Research. They have\r\nprovided an interesting vantage for how to set up problems to reflect\r\nfactors one cares most about. In addition, to really frame a problem\r\nwith requirements and an enterprise view of the full life cycle of a\r\nsystem (i.e., “cradle to grave”). One powerful element to this type of\r\nthinking in-step with optimization is to know where embedding optimizers\r\n1) make the most sense and 2) provides the most impact. Too cool!\r\nBlog Goals\r\nOverview\r\nThis blog is the product of a concept I recently heard about\r\ninfamously classified as learning out load. So in hopes to\r\nshare concepts I’ve learned from the amazing field of optimization, I\r\nwill be regularly assembling varying degrees of optimization problems\r\nhere. The principle aim of this blog is to communicate how to formulate\r\nand implement optimization problems in R.\r\nConcept Map\r\nOptimization Daily is a place for lovers of optimization. Some\r\ngeneral categories this blog hopes to speak to include:\r\nConvex Optimization,\r\nNon-linear Programming,\r\nLinear Programming,\r\nInteger Programming, and\r\nNetwork Flows Optimization.\r\nOther intersecting fields are of interest, including:\r\nSimulations,\r\nSystems Thinking, and\r\nSystem Dynamics.\r\nThe explosion of data and data science methods will direct blog\r\ninterests in some of the following areas also:\r\nStatistical Optimization,\r\nMachine Learning,\r\nDeep Learning,\r\nDecision Science Optimization Applications,\r\nBusiness Application to Optimization, and\r\nSocial Applications to Optimization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
